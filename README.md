# pentest-vm-config
An Ansible project to configure VMs for pentesting. Manually setting up VMs is starting to be a bit of a hassle. Think of installing tools and configuring them, global git settings, creating SSH keys, changing the default shell to ZSH, etc.. Everything is set to be idempotent, and rerunning the playbook will also update all tools.

Most tools will be installed with apt, however python tools use pipx. Tools that can't be installed with apt or pipx, will be pulled directly from GitHub and stored in the `~/Desktop/tools` folder.

* apt (non-python tools)
* pipx (python tools)
* git (other)

## Install
Therefore, to use this repository, a couple of programs are required:

* git (to clone this repo & to pull tools)
* pipx (to install python tools, including ansible)
* ansible (to configure the VM)

Oneliner to install all programs:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y git pipx && pipx install ansible --include-deps && pipx ensurepath && exec $SHELL
```

Next, clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fjfinch/pentest-vm-config.git
```

## Run
To run the playbook, go to the `ansible/` folder and run:

```bash
# Add the '-C' flag to test the playbook without changing a thing on the VM
ansible-playbook main.yml -i inventory.ini -K
```

To make sure to uphold most best practices:

```bash
ansible-lint main.yml
```
